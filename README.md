# GNI DATA ANALYSIS & VISUALIZATION USING R

## DATASET
**Please go through Gross National Income Per Capita.csv first**
The Dataset I am using is obtained from kaggle.com, created from Human Development Reports.
- Gross National Income Per Capita is a key economic indicator that measures the average income earned by individuals in a country. Disparities in GNI per capita among different countries can highlight variations in income distribution and economic development levels.
